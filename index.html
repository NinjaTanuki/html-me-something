                    <h2><a name="berserk">Berserk!</a></h2>  
                        <p>"<i><strong style="color: red; font-size:24px">WARNING!</strong> this is one if not the most brutal and depressing stories I have read.While i believe the contents of this manga is presented tastefully, this manga is not for the light of heart or those easily triggered by depictions of rape, murder, gore, and other similar themes. You have been warned.</i>
                        </p>
                        <p>"This manga follows the story of Gut's a wondering mercenary as he overcomes major hardships on a quest for Survival. After abandoning the mercenary group that initaly took him in heacts as a lone wolf, striking down all those who would be unfourtunate enough to meet his path. This all changes on day when he is discovered by a man name griffith who recruits the reluctant Guts into his Mercenary group The band of hawks.The two soon form a strong bond in pursuit of their goals, only to be met With tragedy after tragedy.
                            Will they ever reach their goals? or will the seemingly impossiable to overcome obsticals be their ultimate demise?"
                            </p>
                        <p>Hopefully I did not the give to much away in that summary! I stubbled across this when I was about 12 years old and while I was enamored with its amazing art and graphic almost gut wrenching depictions, I could hardly wrap my head around such a morbid story.Fortunatly over the years I have come to recognize what the writer is truely trying to convey in a story fully a tragedy.Its a must read for any fan of japanese manga or anime.It updates bi monthly and is still going strong with 351 chapters</p>

                    <h2><a name="breaker">The Breaker Series</a></h2>    
                        <p>"Shi-Woon yi is a young highschool student who is fed up with being bullied by his fellow classmates. After discovering the new subsitiute teacher,Chun-Woo Han, is a martial artist he begs
                            for the teacher to instruct him how to properly defend himself.though reluctant at first Shi-woon and his teacher soon form a strong bond... but at what cost! Chun-woo has now introduced 
                            Shi-woon into the world of Murim, a underground society of brutal martial artist. Fortunatly for him his teacher is the best there is! will he be able to survive in such a world?>"</p>
                        <p>This one is technically cheating as it is not a manga but a manwha, a Korean graphic novel, BUT! it is by far the best martial arts manga i have read. It is Filled with amazing semi over the top action
                            scenes and a story that has you fully invested in its characters and their progression. this story is broken up into 2 parts at the moment. The Breaker and The Breaker: New Waves. Unfourtunaly
                            the story is complete and Part 3 has yet to be annouced since the ending of New Waves in 2014. Even so This is still Very much worth the read finished or not!
                            </p>

                    <h2><a name="tokyo">Tokyo Ghoul</a></h2>
                        <p>"Tokyo is now a modern day dystopia as mysterious man eating creatures called ghouls walk undetected amongst the human populace.They posses super human strength and endurance with a special preditory organ called a "Kagune"."
                            The only force stoping the ghouls form wreaking compleet havok on civilian populace is the CCG(Commision of Counter Ghouls).We hollow Ken Kaneki a quite unssepecting colleged student, who's first date Truns out to be a ghoul herself.

                        <p>This manga is among the best to be published in the last 5 years. Unfoutunalty this manga is another psycological tragedy full of mystery and horror elements boasting amazing visuals. It offers light escapeism for the reader to connect and grow along with the main charcter routing for him to succeed. However with every push forward
                            he always seems to find himself 2 step back yet again. Even with this being the case the writer has still found away to keep the story enticing enough for you wanting more with is unquie supporting chracter and antagonist.The managa has two parts Tokyo Ghoul and Tokyo Ghoul:Re the latter still ongoing. Again anothe 
                            must read if not for the art alone.</p>

                        <p>This anime falls very close to my heart makes is considered a must watch by many anime fans. Infact I would go as far to say you are not a true fan if you have not atleast watched a few epsiode of this amazing anime.There are two versions The orginal 2006 full metal alchmeist anime which is an atlernate telling of the sotry and the 2009 brotherhood anime which stays true to its source material.
                            The 2009 anime is conseried far superior as its animation is top notch and  its paceing is spot on compared to the 2006 version.Both are about 50 epsidoes long and no matter which one you choose to watch both will have you wanting more by the end.Fourtunalty both verision have movies that take place during and after the ending of the show.</p>

                    <h2><a name="toradora">Toradora!</a></h2>
                        <p>"While Ryuji Takasu looks like a deliquent because of his indmidating face he is rally a gental highschool student with a love for housework.Then you have Taiga Aisaka who at first glance appears to be doll like but in reality is a feirce as her First name suggest.
                            Their paths cross when an emrassing mistake makes clear to Ryuji that this feirce girl has a crush on his best friend! Not only that but it turns out Ryuji also has a crush on Taigas best friend! Will these two be able to help eachother confess properly to their love intrest before its too late?"</p>
                        <p>For a while I only watched yoru typical shounen anime and couldnt be bothered to watch slice of life animes because of how lame i thought they where. BUT OH MAN! OH MAN! This anime changed everything for me. The characters are so well rounded and every epsidoe bring something new to the table. While it can be cliche at times the unqiue and realist problems the chracters encounter more than make up for that
                            This anime sets the standard for its genre.For a 26 episode long show its Ealisy the best love story I have ever watched.10 out of 10 must watch! </p>

                    <h2><a name="bleach">Bleach</a></h2>    
                        <p>"Ichigo Kurosaki is you adverage everyday highschool student... except for the fact that he can see the Spirits!! while this dosent cause him much concern since hes been able to see them since he was young that changes one day when his family is attacked by a corrupt spirit called a hollow. While he initially stands no chance against the beast the tables are turned when the local Soul Reaper (A death god) Rukia  who is injured while protecting Ichigo imbues him with her soul reaper powers!
                            With the monster now defeated it is revealed that rukia cannot regain her powers, leaving Ichigo the task of protecting the town against any hollow threat that should arise! "</p>
                        <p>Bleach is rather long boasting a whopping 365 episodes and while at its introduction was apart of the big 3 anime ( naruto and one peice) that took off in popularity among western and japanese audiences is now considered mediocre at best.and while that may be true i consider it one of the most action animes ever produced. While it may seem a bit shallow at first the story gradually picks up as it explores concepts of death, sacrifice, as the main character Ichigo fights to protect his family friends.</p>
