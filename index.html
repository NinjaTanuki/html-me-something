                    <p>"<i><strong style="color: red; font-size:24px">WARNING!</strong> this is one if not the most brutal and depressing stories I have read.While i believe the contents of this manga is presented tastefully, this manga is not for the light of heart or those easily triggered by depictions of rape, murder, gore, and other similar themes. You have been warned.</i>
                    </p>

                    <p>Hopefully I did not the give to much away in that summary! I stubbled across this when I was about 12 years old and while I was enamored with its amazing art and graphic almost gut wrenching depictions, I could hardly wrap my head around such a morbid story.Fortunatly over the years I have come to recognize what the writer is truely trying to convey in a story fully a tragedy.Its a must read for any fan of japanese manga or anime.</p>

                <h2>The Breaker Series</h2>    
                    <p>"Shi-Woon yi is a young highschool student who is fed up with being bullied by his fellow classmates. After discovering the new subsitiute teacher,Chun-Woo Han, is a martial artist he begs
                        for the teacher to instruct him how to properly defend himself.though reluctant at first Shi-woon and his teacher soon form a strong bond... but at what cost! Chun-woo has now introduced 
                        Shi-woon into the world of Murim, a underground society of brutal martial artist. Fortunatly for him his teacher is the best there is! will he be able to survive in such a world?>"</p>
                    <p>This one is technically cheating as it is not a manga but a manwha, a Korean graphic novel, BUT! it is by far the best martial arts manga i have read. It is Filled with amazing semi over the top action
                       scenes and a story that has you fully invested in its characters and their progression. this story is broken up into 2 parts at the moment. The Breaker and The Breaker: New Waves. Unfourtunaly
                       the story is complete and Part 3 has yet to be annouced since the ending of New Waves in 2014. Even so This is still Very much worth the read finished or not!
